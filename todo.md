# Todo
- Implement a Notion-like editor.
- Is it still worth implementing a WYSIWYG editor?

# Features
- Image editor
  - First, a simple text replacer.
  - Then, a gallery that selects images from the MarkdownToFields image folder.
- Multilanguage editor: A way to compare the field and how it reads in multiple languages. In the same view, display the main language, with equivalent translations shown below or to the side.
