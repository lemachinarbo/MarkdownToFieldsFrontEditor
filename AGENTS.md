# MarkdownToFieldsFrontEditor Context

MarkdownToFieldsFrontEditor (MFE) is the **front-end editor** for the `MarkdownToFields` ProcessWire module. It allows users to double-click tagged content to edit and preview it directly on the page. It is NOT a standalone module; it only works together with `MarkdownToFields`.

## Core Philosophy

- **Markdown-First Pipeline**: Outside of an editing session, the persisted Markdown file is the absolute source of truth.
- **Canonical Document State**: During editing, MFE keeps **one canonical `DocumentState` draft per language** as the authoritative mutable state.
- **Scope as a Lens**: Scope (field, subsection, section, or document) is just a view into the canonical state. No scope creates a second document. Changing scope doesn't change content, only the portion in focus.
- **Deterministic Mutability**: Scope edits mutate the one canonical body via a single mutation engine (`applyScopedEdit`). Save is centralized, guarded, and blocked if readback validation fails.

## Key Terminology & Architecture

- **DocumentState (`src/document-state.js`)**: Holds the language draft and persisted body. Emits lifecycle events (`STATE_OPENED`, `STATE_UPDATED`, `STATE_SAVED`).
- **Scope Session (`src/scope-session.js`)**: Locks a state to an active scope key. Prevents cross-scope accidental writes.
- **Interfaces & Modes**:
  - *Fullscreen*: Strict canonical pipeline, reference implementation.
  - *Inline*: Intentionally limited WYSIWYG editor on top of the frontend.
  - *Split View*: Shows multiple independent document states (e.g., side-by-side multi-language) without merging them.

## Debugging

- **Quiet by Default**: Logs are quiet during normal usage. Turn on debug mode for deeper logs.
- **Runtime Keys**: 
  - `data-mfe`, `data-mfe-source` → author's template definition.
  - `data-mfe-key` → final runtime ID (the important one).
- **DevTools Commands**:
  - `window.MarkdownFrontEditor.recompile()`: Rebuilds and restamps editable IDs.
  - `window.MarkdownFrontEditor.watch()` / `unwatch()`: Auto-recompile toggles.
- **Contract Tracer**: Turn on via `localStorage.setItem("mfeDebugAssert", "1")` to inspect invariant violations in `window.__MFE_CONTRACT_VIOLATIONS__`.

## Developer Environment
- **Build Tooling**: MFE has a frontend build pipeline. Changes in `src/` must be compiled using `npm run build` (or Vite equivalent).
- **PHP Runtime**: Always use **`ddev php`** for running any PHP CLI commands.

## Git & Commit Standards
- **No Auto-Committing**: Never run `git commit` autonomously. Instead, suggest that changes are ready and propose exactly what the commit message should be in a code block for the user to execute manually.
- **Flat History Only**: Never create merge commits. Always squash or rebase to maintain a linear timeline.
- **Commit Format**: Strictly follow the Conventional Commits specification. This drives the automated changelog.
- **Translation Logic (Strict Mapping)**:
   - `add` -> commit as `feat: [description]`
   - `fix` -> commit as `fix: [description]`
   - `remove`, `update`, or `refactor` -> commit as `refactor: [description]`
   - `chore` -> commit as `chore: [description]` (for internal config, tooling, and repo maintenance).
   - **Constraint**: If a request uses a verb outside this list, stop and ask for the correct mapping. Do not infer.
- **Message Structure (Required)**:
   - Subject line must be exactly: `<type>: <imperative description>`
   - Add a blank line after subject
   - Add a short bullet body describing concrete changes
   - Use `- ` bullets only (no nested lists)
- **Style Rules**:
   - **Case**: The entire subject line must be lowercase.
   - **No Fluff**: No emojis, no "AI-generated" or "Verified" footers, and no trailing periods.
   - **Length**: Keep the subject line concise (under 50 characters).

# ProcessWire Module Coding Contract

You are assisting with **ProcessWire module** development.

## Mantra

- This is a **module**, not an application.
- **Keep it simple. Trust ProcessWire.**
- Prefer **clear, boring, readable** code over cleverness.
- Use **native ProcessWire APIs and conventions**.
- Avoid enterprise patterns, DSLs, magic helpers, and unnecessary indirection.
- If there’s **one obvious way**, do that.

These are **hard constraints**, not preferences.

## 1) Simplicity & Abstraction Gate

Prefer the **simplest correct implementation**—code a human can understand top-to-bottom.

Do **not** introduce abstractions (services, interfaces, factories, managers, adapters, DTOs, utility layers, etc.) unless they solve a **real, current** problem.

An abstraction is allowed **only if all three are true**:
- It removes real duplication or existing complexity.
- It makes the code easier for a human to understand.
- It is used in **at least two concrete places**.

Avoid premature generalization. Optimize for **clarity, maintainability, and debuggability**—not sophistication.

## 2) Framework First

- ProcessWire already provides lifecycle, safety, permissions, and IO.
- **Do not reimplement ProcessWire responsibilities or APIs.**
- Always look for existing API methods before adding your own.
- If you’re unsure, **ask or check the docs**.
- Prefer exposing **data via APIs** over adding “smart” behavior helpers.
- Refactors must be **behavior-preserving** unless explicitly instructed:
  - do not change semantics, output, side effects, or data shape.

## 3) Code Style & Structure

- Prefer **explicit, linear** code.
- Minimal indirection.
- One obvious way > flexible abstractions.
- Inline small logic instead of creating layers to “organize” it.
- No “architecture as aesthetics”: avoid patterns for their own sake.

## 4) Error Handling & Boundaries

Use `try/catch` **only** at real system boundaries:
- external input
- persistence
- framework calls documented to throw

Rules:
- Never catch exceptions “just to be safe”.
- Never swallow exceptions silently.
- If failure is unrecoverable, **fail loudly**.

## 5) Determinism, Fallbacks, and Layers

Do not add defensive fallbacks inside **deterministic** logic.  
Do not turn deterministic systems into probabilistic ones.

Layer rule:
- **Core logic** → strict. No fallbacks. Throw on invalid state or missing required data.
- **Boundary layer** → tolerant. Fallbacks allowed for external uncertainty (IO, network, user input).
- **UI layer** → user-friendly. Convert errors into messages; never silence them.

If it indicates a bug: **fail fast**.  
If it can happen normally: **handle gracefully**.

## 6) Data & Mutability

- Parsed data is **canonical** and immutable after creation.
- No post-parse fixing, patching, or mutation.
- If transformation is needed, do it **before** object creation.

Projection helpers are allowed only if:
- they are **pure**
- they do not recompute or invent data
- they do not mutate originals

## 7) Logging

- Log only when something **meaningful changes**.
- One log per actual mutation (max).

Never log:
- function entry
- configuration dumps
- no-ops
- early exits

## 8) Templates

- Templates are **dumb**.
- No helpers required to “fix” data for templates.
- If templates need logic, the **data model is wrong**.

## 9) When Proposing Changes

- Default to the **smallest possible change**.
- Prefer documentation over behavior changes.
- Prefer explicit **opt-in** helpers over automatic behavior.
- Avoid adding new public methods unless they **expose data**, not behavior.

## 10) Tone

- Be direct.
- No cheerleading.
- No summaries unless explicitly requested.
- If something is over-engineered, say so plainly.
